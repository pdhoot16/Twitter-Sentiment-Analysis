# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a project based on big data analytics. This project will help us to analyze sentiment based on the tweets on a particular topic. Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It is also called as Opinion Mining. It is used to understand how people feel about the topic based on the tweets on that specific topic. 
The topic we have chosen here to analyze the sentiment is Brexit.  

### What is Brexit? 

Brexit is short for "British exit" - and is the word people use to refer to the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries which trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work. 
 
### Why Brexit? 

A public vote - called a referendum - was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. The Leave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m - but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019.  
 
Now that Brexit has passed, using Twitter Sentiment Analysis we can find out the overall sentiment on Brexit. Negative being people are not happy with the Brexit. Positive being they are in favor of Brexit. Neutral being they are indifferent with it.
